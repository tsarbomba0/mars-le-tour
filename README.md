# Mars-le-tour

**This is my attempt at making a library to create Discord bots.**

## Some stuff worth saying
index.ts contains a really small test bot.

## Current functionality
Currently the library offers a guild Map object, several events related to guilds, interactions and messages.
Resuming in case of a terminated connection is also supported.

## Goals
Full functionality
Optimizations
Voice API support
